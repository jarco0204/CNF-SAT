    This file is the graph solution to the monographic triangle problem.

    Input: An n-node undirected graph G(V,E) with node set V and edge set E. 

    Question: Can the edges, E, of G be partitioned into two disjoint sets E1 and E2, in such a way that neither of the two graphs G1(V,E1) or G2(V,E2) contains a triangle, i.e. a set of three distinct nodes u,v,w such that {u,v}, {u,w}, {v,w} are all edges?
    
    Output: True or false (NP)-Proof verifiable if nondeterministic polynomial time.
