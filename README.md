## Random Instance Generator Module
Creates a stochastic UNDIRECTED GRAPH in adjanceny form.
e.g., {"1": [2,3,4],
        "2": [3,4]...,
        }
# Note: Keys are str and value array are ints

GraphGenerator.py returns the random created adjacency matrix
•Where [i][j]= 1 v 0 indicates if there is an edge connecting vertices i and j.

# Note
Logic sets matrix such that loops are not permitted.


## Monochromatic Triangle Module
• Solves the problem.

## Main Module
Controls the program flow.
